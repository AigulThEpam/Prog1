Like the legend of the Phoenix, huh
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning, ah
The force from the beginning, hm, love

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

The present has no rhythm
Your gift keeps on givin'
What is this I'm feeling?
If you wanna leave I'm with it, ah
